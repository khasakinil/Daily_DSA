/**
 * 428. Serialize and Deserialize N-ary Tree
 * We need to serialize and then deserialize an N-ary tree. 
 * Here serialization means to convert the tree structure into a string so we can store it into a file or transmit it across a network, 
 * and then bring it back into its original structure through deserialization.
 * For example, let us consider a 3-ary tree:
 * 	    	1
 *  	 /  |  \
 *  	3   2   4
 * 	   / \
 * 	   5 6
 * 
 * We may serialize this into string: "1 3 2 4 5 6"
 * Now, the task is to convert this string back into its original tree structure through deserialization.
 * The problem states that there is no restriction on how the serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.
 * The only constraints are:
 * N lies in the range of 1 to 1000.
 * We should not use class member/global/static variables to store states.
